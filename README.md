# LookerScripts



**Welcome**

Please read these important caveats before using scripts in this repository: 
- Looker Support does NOT support these scripts. These are scripts written, collected, or adapted by me personally and are NOT official workflows. Please use these scripts as examples, NOT as code that can by copy-pasted and work out of the box. 
- These scripts are not regularly tested, and may be out of date with later versions of Looker.
- For most python scripts, I've included a notebook (.ipynb) version as well as a .py version

**The Scripts**

- DownloadMultiTileTabbed - Downloads a singular dashboard with any number of tiles as a Tabbed Excel file
- DownloadMultiLookTabbed - Downloads any number of Looks as a single Tabbed Excel file
- DownloadDashboardUnlimited - Downloads unlimited results from a singular dashboard with any number of tiles as a Tabbed Excel file.
